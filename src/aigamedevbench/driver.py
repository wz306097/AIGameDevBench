    """Runs an arbitrary CLI harness inside the workspace to complete the task.

    The command template is shlex-split (template paths should use forward slashes
    on Windows), then each token has placeholders substituted: {task} (raw task
    text as a single arg), {task_file} (path to workspace/TASK.md), {workspace}
    (workspace path). No shell is used, so the task text can contain any
    characters without injection risk.

    Output is streamed live (line by line) to the log and to an optional on_line
    callback, so a harness that blocks (e.g. on its own permission prompt) is
    visible immediately instead of only after the overall timeout. The harness's
    stdin is closed: an interactive prompt then gets EOF and should fail fast
    rather than hang. Two watchdogs guard against a silent hang: stall_timeout
    (no output for that long -> abort) and a set of approval-prompt markers that
    abort the run early with a clear hint.
